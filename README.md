# Maxflow-Mincut
How to use max-flow min-cut algorithm (C++)

This is demonstrated by taking a simple 3x3 matrix
and a basic unary and pair-wise functions.

I hope that this example(src/example_maxflow.cpp) can be very handy in
understanding the graph structure of maxflow-mincut framework and will provide
in-depth intuition of it. 

Kindly, go through the src/README.TXT and src/GPL.TXT if you are using
max-cut min-flow algorithm for different purpose. 

Dependencies: C++.
Tested on Linux, Ubuntu 13.04 and 14.04.
